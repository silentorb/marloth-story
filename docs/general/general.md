# General Marloth Documentation

### Awe

One of the primary goals of a Marloth narrative is to inspire awe.  Most of the rules in this document are either directly or indirectly derived from this root goal.

Wonder can be a synonym for awe, which is fitting since one of Marloth's primary influences is Lewis Carrol's "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland".  Marloth is a type of Wonderland.

### Brevity

#### Rules

The writing style of Marloth is concise. Verbosity should be minimized. This includes:

* No lengthy descriptions.
  * Occasional paragraph-long descriptions can exist if they have strong meta-physical implications.
* No detailed descriptions.
  * Character's physical appearance should be vague with only a few key highlights.
* Skipping narrations that do not have major significance.
  * As an example, narrating how a character travels from one point to another.
  * Action sequences can be a little more detailed, but should still be no more than a paragraph at a time and sparsely used.
* Dialogue is allowed lengthier passages.  A single dialogue can span multiple pages, though dialogue of that length should not be frequent.

#### Reasons

* I like efficient communication.
* I don't like filler text.  A reader's time is important and should be used preciously.  The honor of reading is bestowed on the writer, not the reader.
* Dense, significant communication overwhelms the audience, helping add awe.
* Minimal text lends itself to Marloth's high concentration of [implication](#Implication).

* It's more efficient to write.  (This is offset by the work it takes to manage so many dimensions in a Marloth narrative.  Traditional story telling is more verbose but the verbosity is also more loosely coupled like a string of islands.)

### Implication

#### Rules

Marloth relies heavily on implication.

* Whenever something can be deduced, provide just enough information to require that deduction.
* Use pronouns liberally, as long as it does not cause [ambiguity](#Ambiguity).
  * All ambiguous pronouns are [confusing](#Confusion).
  * Exception: if the identity of the target is clearly hidden from the reader.
    * Example: "Suddenly **someone** screamed."

#### Reasons

* It exercises the reader's imagination.
* It adds a sense of mystery.
* It can assist brevity.
* Implication is the salt of humor.
* It can add [ambiguity](#Ambiguity).

### Ambiguity

#### Rules

* [Confusion](#Confusion) should be avoided.

#### Reasons

#### Confusion

When this documentation uses the word ambiguity, it is generally referring to positive ambiguity. This is in contrast to negative ambiguity.

Positive ambiguity is when a communication supports multiple logical interpretations and all of those interpretations are desirable by the author.

Negative ambiguity is when a communication supports multiple logical interpretations and one or more of those interpretations are contrary to the author's intent.

Within this documentation, negative ambiguity is referred to as confusion.  Confusion should be avoided.

### Mystery

Mystery is a critical ingredient for Marloth.  Mystery evokes [awe](#Awe).  Arguably, awe is impossible without some element of mystery.

I love mystery, but I don't like mystery novels.  The term *mystery novel* is almost a misnomer.  The purpose of a mystery novel is to destroy mystery.  Or, more generously, to create a mystery and then dismantle it.  Once a reader has finished reading a mystery novel, any awe that was generated by the novel's mystery is gone.
