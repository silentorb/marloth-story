# James Career

## Overview

* The audience needs to see James' career slowly advance
  * This means starting out low and slowly increasing

* James eventually becomes an expert not in magic, but in the dangers of magic
  * A guide for adventurers lost in the wilderness
* Even at the peak of his career, James probably won't receive appropriate recognition for his credentials

## Requirements

### Domestic

#### Rules

* James occupations should not separate him from home for significant periods of time
* He can occasionally go on adventures but they need to be special cases, not normal requirements for his job

#### Motivation

* I want Marloth to be cozy and revolve around a sense of home
* I want to depict a variety of dramatic marital challenges but an absent father isn't one I'm interested in narrating
