# Cleanup Job

## Overview

* A job James has that involves cleaning up after magical failures

## Motivation

* James needs lowly, introductory jobs before he becomes responsible for the higher profile jobs
* I like how this job is lowly, and yet has a deep perspectiveâ€”James has to face an ugly side of magic that most of the world wants to ignore
  * I'd like a common pattern for James to first arrive at a scene of opulence and activity, and then proceeds (is led by an attendant) to some lower back area that is forsaken and oppressive
