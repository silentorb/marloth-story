# A Survey of Marriage in Fiction and Fantasy

The primary purpose of this article is to inform the design of the second Marloth book, a fantasy novel with a focus on marriage.

This article also has potential to inform on the subject of fiction in marriage in general, though its selection of references are weighted toward Marloth's sub genre, whatever that is.

## Background Marriage

* Many narratives involve married characters but the spouse(s) are not involved much with the story
* That is fine as long as there

### The Romance Genre

* I wonder what the statistic is: something like 99% of romance narratives are about single people?
* Romance within marriage largely doesn't exist in romance media

### Fireproof

* The #1 exception to the singles romance tropeâ€”Fireproof is an excellent romance movie about a married couple

### Non-Romance Fiction

### Notable Fantasy With Little Marriage

* The Lord of the Rings
* The Chronicles of Narnia
* Discworld

### Harry Potter

* While marriage is never a focal point, has a surprising quantity of married characters and a positive view of marriage for a fantasy high school drama

## Super Heroes

### The Fantastic Four

* Two of the main characters are married with kids
* Largely a dysfunctional family with a father that usually prioritizes work over family
  * And that work is often science projects, not fighting bad guys
    * It can be argued that the science projects are ultimately used to fight bad guys, but that is a slippery slope the father is eager to slide down

### The Incredibles

* One of the best super hero family movies, though at the end of the day it is still a super hero movie first, where half of it's depiction of family doesn't translate to your average family unless the father is a secret agent

### Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows

* One of the best depictions of family in comic books, though like the Incredibles, it is still a super hero story with marriage forced into it
