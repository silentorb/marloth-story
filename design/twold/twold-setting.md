# TWOLD Setting

## Abstract

The setting of TWOLD is largely defined by the following concepts;

* [Cozy horror](../general/marloth-narrative-guidelines.md#Cozy)
* [Civilized anarchy](../general/marloth-narrative-guidelines.md#Social Restraint)
* [Surreal](../general/marloth-narrative-guidelines.md#Dreaminess) [allegory](../general/marloth-narrative-guidelines.md#Allegory)

## Perspective

* Similar to the first book, the second story revolves around James and Adelle
  * Since the world of Marloth is [somewhat malleable and always tailored to its particular tale](../general/marloth-narrative-guidelines.md#Adaptive Setting), the world of TWOLD should be tailored to the story of these two newlyweds
