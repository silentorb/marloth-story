## Vision

### Goal

Goal: To make marriage look cool.

Details: By marriage, not just a shallow slice of marriage, but a comprehensive picture of Christian marriage and all that surrounds it.

### Cozy Horror

* Peace in the eye of the storm.

> Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give  your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters;  multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. - Jeremiah 29:5-7

* The [larger context](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029&version=ESV) of that passage is also key.
* Don't just surviveâ€”thrive.

### The Premise

* Start with a collection of characters trapped in a horror setting, attempting to either flee the setting or become more powerful than the dangers
* But there is one exception: two characters marry and attempt to settle down in the midst of the horror
