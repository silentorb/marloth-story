# The Marloth Narrative

This repository consists of four things:

* The source text for the Marloth book series (including books finished and under development)
* Software to compile that source text into distributable e-books
* Marloth E-books
* Design documentation to assist the Marloth writing process

Currently all of the content in this repository is under reserved copyright of Christopher W. Johnson, though the plan is for the e-books to eventually be released under a Creative Commons license and the rest of the contents to be selectively released under either Creative Commons or MIT.
