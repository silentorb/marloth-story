# Nivana's bitterness

Nivana grows jealous of Adelle's marriage and happiness.

Maybe accentuate it by having earlier threads like I was thinking way back where James and Nivana bond to some degree, then have James marry Adelle, then have Nivana find out that James is now taken.  This would need to be tempered—I don't envision Nivana ever madly in love with someone like James, but a small dose might work well.

I should probably make sure the sin is both ways, so that when tempers finally explode, Adelle is at least partially at fault as well.  Maybe more of the fault can still be on Nivana, it doesn't have to be evenly matched, but there's a few reasons to have Adelle mildly wrong Nivana:

1.  It is not healthy to have this particularly hurt be one-sided
2.  It adds one more feature to Adelle's weaknesses
3.  It makes Nivana's pain and indignation more poignant because to a small degree it is justified
4.  It makes Adelle more of a participant of this plot thread instead of just a recipient

As to the form of Adelle's wrongdoing, I don't know about that yet.  The ham-fisted approach would be to have Adelle lord it over Nivana—the more subtle approach would be Adelle to be condescending.  In the latter vein, maybe Adelle could excessively conclude that Nivana is dangerous and treat her like a dangerous menace.  Maybe she could do it in the name of protecting one or more people.  The ideal candidate would be a child if she had one, otherwise maybe James would be the next best candidate.  Maybe James and Nivana hit it off well and Adelle is jealous?  Once again I don't like having much romance between James and Nivana, but the story keeps pushing that direction even if it clashes with the character definitions.  If this wasn't a sequel and I was designing these characters fresh I would consider changing their personalities to better align with this direction, or replacing one of them with a different character altogether, but I think I'm too settled with both James and Nivana to significantly adjust either of them or their place in this story.

If this thread continues much longer I'll move some of these notes out of this record and into a love-triangle record.  (I wasn't planning on a love triangle.)
