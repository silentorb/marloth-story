# Introduce James and Ghost Adelle

This scene is a Prelude candidate.

* Some battle or something like that is taking place in a dark forest
* **Cozy**: Maybe have Drenodir and his soldiers encamped around a fire?
  * With the **light/dark** theme, they have an almost excessive amount of lamps and lanterns around the fire to keep away the shadow creatures
* James tries to hide the ghost from Drenodirâ€”James is ashamed
* Drenodir chides James for ignoring the plight of the people around him, and for clinging to the ghost
* At first James argues and then he sort of wakes up and realizes his sin
* The ghost is tethered to a small booklet which James throws into the fire
* The ghost disappears, though I kind of feel like only implying this
* Drenodir and his men know how to deal with the supernatural dangers, but the other groups of soldiers in the woods do not and are getting routed
* Drenodir and his men have their hands full trying to hold their current position and can't afford to assist the other soldiers
* James sets out into the woods to act as a roamer and help the other soldiers
