## Blockers

### Continuity

* One of the main points at the end of the first book was that the good enchantment needs maintenance or it will crumble.
* James is one of the few or only character with memory of the previous book.

### Main Issues and Points

* Dependency
  * Everyone except God depends on something
    * People tend to ignore dependencies
    * People tend to have a false sense of independence
    * Everyone depends on God to some degree
    * In areas where a person rejects dependence on God, they are instead depending on evil
  * People need God
  * People need people
    * Christians need other Christians (the church)
* Inside every heart is a war between good and evil
  * Good people are tempted to do evil
    * Good people sometimes do bad things
  * Evil people have a conscience that is still pricked
    * Evil people sometimes do good things
  * Evil forces are trying to sway people
  * Good forces are trying to sway people
  * It is not good to be on the sidelines of this war
* False church
  * Being in a cookie jar doesn't make a mouse a cookie
  * Pharasees
    * Misguide weak Christians
    * Oppose strong Christians
    * Repulse non-Christians
  * False churches are used as a straw man argument against Christianity
    * More generally, stories sometimes present a weak good to justify a strong bad
* Gray hero fallacy
  * The world likes to think that gray heroes are cool
  * There are no real gray heroes
    * Gray heroes are really villains
  * Gray heroes rebel against God
  * Gray heroes hurt people
* Worship
  * You must worship your dependencies
  * Atheists pretend worship is optional
    * Everyone worships something
* There is no bargaining with evil
  * Giving in to evil's demands only results in more evil
* Submission
  * Dependence on other people requires submission
  * People chafe against submission
    * Some more than others
  * Like Ecclesiastes, there's a time to submit and a time to rebel
    * Sometimes we need to submit to people we don't agree with
  * Humility brings a submissive heart

### Dependence

With dependence being such a major theme of the story, what are the primary dependencies that will be focused on?

* God
* Idols
* Magic
* Light
* Darkness
* Marloth (the book)
* People

Out of all of these, Magic and people are the only neutral dependencies and the most universally fought over.

### Main Enemies

* The Merchant of Sorcerers
* The Goddess of Feminism
* The God of Atheism
* False Priest (Bishop?)
* Ruler whose family becomes magic dependent
* Representative Necromancer
* The God of Lust
* Demon Lord?

### Biblical Inspiration

### Main Characters

The main characters are James and Nivana, and they have no relationship.

### Desires

So much of what makes a story engaging and driving is for the main characters to have well-defined and meaningful desires.

#### What does James want?

* Restrain his zombie nature
* Find Adelle
* Apologetics
* Fight evil
* Write a book

##### Apologetics

Much of James' character is an apologist.  He stands up for truth and argues in its favor.  Even though he's reserved he has no problem stepping foward in a public forum.

At its heart, Marloth is a war for people's souls.  An essential part of that is what people believe.  Marloth is a battle for mind share.

#### What does Nivana want?

- Respect
- Influence
- To utilize her talents
- Power, but only to assist her other desires
- To be a good person
- To help society/community
- To fight injustice

#### James and Nivana

Where do their desires overlap?  What do they both want?

* They both are debaters.  They care deeply about the truth and what others believe.
* They both want to fight evil, though they focus on different forms of evil.
* Both want to be good and restrain their sinful natures.
* Neither is very empathetic.

Where do they differ?

* Adelle wants respect and influence.  James disgregards these.
  * Which is ironic for James because he tends to miss out on their benefits non realizing what he is missing.
* James sometimes thinks about power but that is generally not something he is pursuing.
* Nivana does not care about James' finding Adelle.
* Nivana would see James' book writing as low priority.

## Proposals

### Story Direction

Nivana is a more proactive character than James.  What if the story starts with her and then she needs to find James and convince him to team up with her?

* Instead of the typical quest scenario of some aged character telling her she needs to find James, she figures out from pieces of information that James has a unique utility.
* The main benefit of James in this case should probably be his ability to travel between dreams.

#### If So, Then How?
