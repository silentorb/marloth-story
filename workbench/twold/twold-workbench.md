* The world is the Asylum
* James and Adelle as a married couple and as children

### The Endgame

* The blessed city becomes the cursed city
* In every heart is a war between light and darkness
* Plot to weaken the Christ character by killing belief is foiled.  The Christ character doesn't need belief.
* God's power and good is made more evident
* Gray heroes are exposed
* Seemingly invincible villain(s) revealed to have many dependencies that crumble
* The heroes are more united than ever

## Dependence

With dependence being such a major theme of the story, what are the primary dependencies that will be focused on?

* God
* Idols
* Magic
* Light
* Darkness
* Marloth (the book)
* People / Souls

Out of all of these, Magic and people are the only neutral dependencies and the most universally fought over.



## Biblical Inspiration

## Prose

"You have a large cistern.  You could hold more magic than three of my girls.  Very valuable."

"So I have the job?"

"No, I'm not giving you any job."

"What?  That doesn't make any sense!  Why won't you hire me?"

"Because word's gotten around/about that you can use magic.  You're an empty gun, and no one's fool enough to fill/load you."
