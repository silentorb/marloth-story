## Blockers

### Continuity

* One of the main points at the end of the first book was that the good enchantment needs maintenance or it will crumble.
* James is one of the few or only character with memory of the previous book.

### Main Characters

The main characters are James and Nivana, and they have no relationship.

### Desires

So much of what makes a story engaging and driving is for the main characters to have well-defined and meaningful desires.

#### What does James want?

This question has always been a problem with this book.  I don't know what James wants.  In the previous book his primary desires was to rescue Adelle.  That's what drove him.  Earlier in the book he was also driven by wanting to read Marloth, but that didn't drive the bulk of the story.

Oh, he also wanted to be free from his zombie nature.

That's a good desire, but once again, you have the problem of focusing on the negative instead of the positive.  Focusing exclusively on where you're running from and not where you're running toward will usually result in running into something just as bad as what you were trying to escape.

James' focus should be on being good.  On doing particular good things.  He can forget at times, but only at times.

What good needs doing?

* Rescuing people
* Reading Marloth
* Fellowshipping with Tralvorkemen

James also wants to find Adelle, which is motivated more by idolatry and discontent than love.

#### What does Nivana want?

* Respect
* Influence
* To utilize her talents
* Power, but only to assist her other desires
* To be a good person
* To help society/community

### Story Direction

Nivana is a more proactive character than James.  What if the story starts with her and then she needs to find James and convince him to team up with her?

* Instead of the typical quest scenario of some aged character telling her she needs to find James, she figures out from pieces of information that James has a unique utility.
* The main benefit of James in this case should probably be his ability to travel between dreams.

#### If So, Then How?

* What information leads her to search for James?
* What information directs her where to search for him?

Wait, I already had this idea before.  I'd combine the ghost idea with the James being in the Asylum again idea.  I think I may have even considered Nivana visiting him in prison, though if so that would have been in the Nameless City, not the City of Orphans.

I also had one idea where they were both Asylum patients together.  Having her be a patient sounds both fun and diluting.  Madness is certain character's calling card and I don't want to have too many people be mad, unless its the other idea I had where most everyone turns out to be be patients in the Asylum.

Anyhow, having Nivana visit James at the Asylum while she is in the City of Orphans works really well.  It has thematic continuity and makes it easy to connect the dotsâ€”especially easier than my earlier idea of having James and the ghost start out in the wilderness.

One of the easiest connections would be George.  Somehow he and Nivana meets, he talks about James, and Nivana recognizes supernatural patterns in James' behavior.

The one downside with that idea is so far George has had no direct connection with Nivana, and even if they did meet, why would he start talking about James?  It is contrived.

A second option would be the nurse.  I've already had her connected to the Mediev household in previous versions of TWOLD and could continue to do so even though I've recently considered downplaying the roles of her and her husband.

That approach could lead to a combination of the nurse and George.  The nurse could talk about James earlier on in the story, planting a seed in Nivana's mind that later has more significance in light of later events, spurring Nivana to seek out George.  Once found, she would interrogate him and then use him to manage a direct interview with the little mad boy himself.
