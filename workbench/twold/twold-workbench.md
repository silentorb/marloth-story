## Blockers

### Continuity

* One of the main points at the end of the first book was that the good enchantment needs maintenance or it will crumble.
* James is one of the few or only character with memory of the previous book.

## Main Issues, Points and Themes

* Dependency
  * Everyone depends on something
    * People tend to ignore dependencies
    * People tend to have a false sense of independence
    * Everyone depends on God to some degree
    * In areas where a person rejects dependence on God, they are instead depending on evil
  * People need God
  * People need people
    * Christians need other Christians (the church)
  * Evil looks powerful yet is powerless
* Inside every heart is a war between good and evil
  * Good people are tempted to do evil
    * Good people sometimes do bad things
  * Evil people have a conscience that is still pricked
    * Evil people sometimes do good things
  * Evil forces are trying to sway people
  * Good forces are trying to sway people
  * It is not good to be on the sidelines of this war
* False church
  * Being in a cookie jar doesn't make a mouse a cookie
  * Pharasees
    * Misguide weak Christians
    * Oppose strong Christians
    * Repulse non-Christians
  * False churches are used as a straw man argument against Christianity
    * More generally, stories sometimes present a weak good to justify a strong bad
* Gray hero fallacy
  * The world likes to think that gray heroes are cool
  * There are no real gray heroes
    * Gray heroes are really villains
  * Gray heroes rebel against God
  * Gray heroes hurt people
* Worship
  * You must worship your dependencies
  * Atheists pretend worship is optional
    * Everyone worships something
* There is no bargaining with evil
  * Giving in to evil's demands only results in more evil
* Submission
  * Dependence on other people requires submission
  * People chafe against submission
    * Some more than others
  * Like Ecclesiastes, there's a time to submit and a time to rebel
    * Sometimes we need to submit to people we don't agree with
  * Humility brings a submissive heart
* Shroud of Deceit
  * Throughout these points is a reoccurring theme of light and darkness
  * The villains hide the truth and sell lies
  * The heroes debunk the lies and reveal the truth
* Survival
  * Few mechanics illuminate dependence as well as an indefinite threat to one's survival
  * Survival illuminates people's hearts

## Dependence

With dependence being such a major theme of the story, what are the primary dependencies that will be focused on?

* God
* Idols
* Magic
* Light
* Darkness
* Marloth (the book)
* People

Out of all of these, Magic and people are the only neutral dependencies and the most universally fought over.

## Main Enemies

* The Merchant of Sorcerers
* The goddess of Feminism
* The god of Atheism
* False Priest (Bishop?)
* Ruler whose family becomes magic dependent
* Representative Necromancer
* The god of Lust?
* Demon Lord?

## Biblical Inspiration

## Main Characters

The main characters are James and Nivana, and they have no relationship.

## Desires

So much of what makes a story engaging and driving is for the main characters to have well-defined and meaningful desires.

### What does James want?

* Restrain his zombie nature
* Find Adelle
* Apologetics
* Fight evil
* Write a book

#### Apologetics

Much of James' character is an apologist.  He stands up for truth and argues in its favor.  Even though he's reserved he has no problem stepping foward in a public forum.

At its heart, Marloth is a war for people's souls.  An essential part of that is what people believe.  Marloth is a battle for mind share.

### What does Nivana want?

- Respect
- Influence
- To utilize her talents
- Power, but only to assist her other desires
- To be a good person
- To help society/community
- To fight injustice

## Proposals

### Story Direction

James and Nivana team up to turn on the lights.

James is depressed during the start of the book.  Nivana approaches James, slaps him out of his self-pity, and convinces him to work with her.

## Protagonist Chemistry

* Both are tenacious.
* Both are debaters.
* Both want to fight evil.
* James is not bothered by Nivana's snide attitude
  * Nivana respects that.  He can take a verbal punch.
* Both are intellectual.
* Sometimes Nivana prods James along.  Sometimes James charges forward.
* Nivana has an artistic eye.  James is an artist.
* Nivana needs James to lead, but to some degree she leads *through* him.
* Both speak their minds fearlessly.
* Nivana's mind is more disciplined and deductive.  She helps constrain James to logic.
* Both usually have a plan.
* James' plans are vague, Nivana's are precise.
* Nivana is social; James isn't.  In this respect Nivana performs a similar role for James as Adelle did.
* Nivana recruits people.  Once recruited, people root for James.
* Neither is particularly compassionate or empathetic.
* Both tend to be preoccupied with their goals.
* Nivana at times has magic.  James at times has his dream/zombie abilities.
* Both want to be good and restrain their sinful natures.
* Both are damaged.
* James is quick to forget and forgive.  Nivana holds grudges.
* James rarely tells jokes.  Jokes are a Nivana staple.
* People see James as harmless.  People are threatened by Nivana.
* James trusts women more than Nivana trusts men.
* Nivana wants respect and influence.  James disregards these.
* Nivana often is in pursuit of power.  James rarely is.
* Nivana is older than James.
* Underneath, Nivana is more vulnerable and caring than she acts.
* Nivana has a lot of similarities to the Raven, who was one of James' best friends in the first book.

Don't yet know if they will ever have a romantic relationship.

## Prose

"You have a large cistern.  You could hold more magic than three of my girls.  Very valuable."

"So I have the job?"

"No, I'm not giving you any job."

"What?  That doesn't make any sense!  Why won't you hire me?"

"Because word's gotten around/about that you can use magic.  You're an empty gun, and no one's fool enough to fill/load you."
