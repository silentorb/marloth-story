I have taken up a part time position assisting at the Asylum [after my studies]

One of the more peculiar patients is a child.  His name is James.  His file states that he has been here for quite some time, though he claims he [only] just returned here recently.

But that is only half of what makes James interesting.  The other half is another patient.  Further down the hall is young girl of about the same age.  They are the only children I know of in this Asylum.  The name in her file is Jane Doe, which she herself says is not her name, though she has never provided me with another.

The striking feature of this girl is she knows James.  When she first spoke his name I figured it must be coincidence, but as time has progressed there is no question the James she speaks of is the very same James [up/down] the hall.

[And] she speaks of him constantly.  It is difficult for her to speak of anything else.  Evidently the boy is at least a part of her condition.  [She speaks as though he is the reason for her existence.]

When I went to visit the girl today, I was surprised to find she was gone.  I looked into the matter and could not get a [straight answer] as to where she had been moved to.  This place is [terribly] disorganized; they claim to have misplaced her records and that they will let me know once anything turns up.

I am beginning to suspect they are hiding something.

Today the head doctor of the Asylum met with me about the girl.  He claimed there had never been such a patient.  I said there must be some mistake.  Seeing how much the cases had been related, I asked him if he would tell me that the boy had also never been a patient.  To this the doctor [shook his head], saying that James was actually a well known case and had caused multiple disturbances in the past.
